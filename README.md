Muckit is a cross-platform application that allows users to save and review restaurants. The name comes from a combination of the Korean word for eat (pronounced "Muck") and a bucket list. Currently, the application is in Korean, but we will expand to other languages after sufficient user acquisition. We are set to launch in February 2024.

## Technical Features
- Communication with GraphQL backend
- Social log-in
- Firebase Cloud Messaging to send notifications
- Persistent front end with Redux
- Google Places, Geocoding, Autocomplete APIs + our own curated database to find restaurants and display restaurant information

## Key Features
- View your location in real-time and restaurants near you
- Receive notifications when you are geographically close to a saved restaurant
- View reviews and photos that our users have left about the restaurant
- Follow & save lists curated by our developers
- Create your own "Muckit list": a to-do list of restaurants to visit or eats that you're craving

## Demo
Below is a short demo of Muckit. I apologize for the lack of English UI; I tried my best explain what was going on in the demo. If you have any questions or comments about the video, feel free to reach out (jinwoonggyu@gmail.com)
